# SkyForgeForUnity it's Architecture template for Unity.


## Short description

This architectural template is based on the MVVM pattern. A basic DI container is implemented here, as well as a command Handler 
pattern with a Proxy, to maintain the current state of the game through reactive properties. Flatbuffer is used to quickly download 
configs from Google tables, as it is a powerful enough tool even for large projects, but if you do not want to use it, then in the 
future I will add a convenient ScriptableObject download. It is also planned to improve skyForge in the future by adding new binder and new technologies.

## Installation
